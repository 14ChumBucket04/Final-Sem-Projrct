						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>A resume classifier is an automated tool that analyzes and categorizes resumes based on specific criteria, such as job titles, skills, experience, and education. It uses machine learning algorithms to automatically learn from a dataset of labeled resumes and applies this knowledge to classify new resumes that are input into the system. Resume classifiers are used by recruiters and hiring managers to streamline the recruitment process, reduce bias, and improve the efficiency of the hiring process by automating the initial screening of resumes.</p>

							<p>The project of building a resume classifier involves designing and developing a machine learning model that can automatically analyze and categorize resumes based on specific criteria such as job titles, skills, experience, education, and other relevant information. The goal of this project is to streamline the recruitment and hiring process by automating the initial screening of resumes, thereby saving time and resources for recruiters and hiring managers.</p>
							<p>To build a resume classifier, one needs to start by collecting and labeling a large dataset of resumes. This dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are trained on the training set to learn the patterns and features in the data. Once the model is trained, it is tested on the testing set to evaluate its performance and accuracy.</p>
						    <p>To improve the accuracy of the model, one can use techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling to optimize the model's performance. Once the model is trained and optimized, it can be integrated into a software application or API to be used by recruiters and hiring managers for resume screening and categorization.</p>
							<p>Overall, the project of building a resume classifier requires a combination of machine learning expertise, domain knowledge in recruitment and hiring processes, and software development skills to create an effective and accurate solution for automating the initial screening of resumes.</p>
